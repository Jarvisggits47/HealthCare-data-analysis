# My SQL Healthcare  Data Analysis Project
## Objective
The objective of the Healthcare Data Analysis project is to analyze healthcare-related datasets to derive meaningful insights. This includes tracking patient information, doctors' performance, medical conditions, hospital admissions, billing amounts, and other key metrics essential for understanding trends in healthcare services. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL by solving a wide range of queries, including data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and trend analysis, applicable to healthcare systems.

## Data Sources
- Data Joining: Combining patient and doctor information to derive insights like 
- patient-doctor relationships.
- Billing and Financial Analysis: Calculating total billing amounts for patients and hospitals.
- Medical Condition Tracking: Analyzing the prevalence of medical conditions across different demographics.
- Admission and Discharge Information: Tracking admission durations, trends, and types of admissions.
- Performance Evaluation: Identifying top doctors, hospitals, and medical conditions based on various metrics such as recovery rates and billing amounts.
 
## Key Insights and Usage
- Patient-Doctor Relationships: Optimize doctor workloads and improve patient care.
- Billing Trends: Refine pricing strategies and enhance financial planning.
- Condition Prevalence: Prepare for spikes in common medical conditions.
- Admission Patterns: Optimize bed usage and resource allocation.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluate doctor efficiency and care quality.
- Patient Demographics: Tailor services based on age and medical needs.
